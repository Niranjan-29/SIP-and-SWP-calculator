## üí° What are SIP and SWP?

* **SIP (Systematic Investment Plan):** A method of investing a fixed amount of money in mutual funds or other instruments at regular intervals (usually monthly). It promotes disciplined investing and can reduce the impact of market volatility through rupee cost averaging.

* **SWP (Systematic Withdrawal Plan):** A facility that allows an investor to withdraw a fixed amount of money from their investment corpus at regular intervals. It's an excellent way to create a steady cash flow, especially during retirement.
